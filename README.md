## Description

This project provided a frontend interface where users could upload an image of a vehicle. The image was then sent to a backend service that used Azure Vision to identify the body type and make of the vehicle.

Additionally a premium calculator page would calculate a premium based on a user's driving history. 

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users could upload an image of a vehicle.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** The frontend displayed the identified body type and make of the vehicle.
- **Premium Calculation:** Calculated a premium based on number of risky words in a users vehicle history description.
- **Simple UI:** Built with React, providing a clean and responsive interface.
